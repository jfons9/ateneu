====== Dokukiwix ======

This plugin allows you to build a static HTML version of your wiki. \\
It has been built to be used with [[http://www.kiwix.org|Kiwix]], a XUL interface by the french company [[http://www.linterweb.com|Linterweb]] which will allow you to add an offline search engine to your wiki. 

This plugin needs a recent browser and Javascript activated, as it makes use of AJAX.\\
Building an offline version of your dokuwiki takes a long time. You need to let the page open until the process has finished.
