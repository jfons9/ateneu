Fix #834 - Wrong message on group deletion
CartManager is triggering the old-fashion public link
Make sure to push the newly activated plugins at the end of the list. Should fix #822
Transport a contextual user ID as a node property or through the URL. Pass a contextual user to the VarsFilter::filter() function Fix shareEventsForwarding when in a personal workspace (shared events not going to parents, preventing sync for example)
Performances: do not call getRole() again if role is already loaded in the loop
Meta.mount: New option to delete mount point on unmount

Error in slug generation, make sure to look at the reserved slugs when building new ones
Share users list: Add an option to not trigger any listing if no regexp is sent

Use loadNodeInfo() instead of stat in ChangesTracker, otherwise eventForwarding can end up indexing a folder as file.
[index.lucene] Typo calling getUser() on wrong object
Introduce an AJXP_METADATA_ALLUSERS metadata users scope to gather meta from all users. Used in eventForwarding for ShareCenter.
Big refactoring to decouple meta.syncable from index.lucene: core.index is now responsible for triggering a recursive indexation and sending corresponding events.

Fix inZip detection for UserSelection built without "dir" parameter.
Set pydio global variable from within AjaXplorer class, not only Bootstrap (skip updating bootstrap)

Close SearchEngine on context_changed
Mark a repository for REQUIRES_INDEXATION at share time. Trigger indexation if necessary when requiring changes - Fix auto-indexation on first search.
Trigger events on workspace before/after create/update/delete Hook indexers (lucene & meta.syncable) to the after_delete event to clear the indexes.
Sync: trigger client last_seq reset if the sequence ID is greater than the current max of the changes table. Foresee the need to vacuum the changes table.
Search results are limited by max-height (ndeet)
Fix Dav configuration when Server URL is set (andypmuc)
Sanitize function: trim spaces only no the left, or it can break when syncing files with trailing space
Secure error message on rename operations by catching the result
